# Ideas for Spring
* Maybe sort teams by least number of participants
* Add flag to indicate team is "full"
* Team create: check off what skills you're bringing to the team
* Team create:Team Description gets changed to problem pitch (keep away from solution and focus on problem)
* Team create: update problem types
* Team channel names maynot be autocreated
* Admin can associate a team to a channel
* Admin page / authorization 
* capture usage meterics for teams and users
* questions we want answers to: "how many searches are done?" "When were teams created?"" etc...
